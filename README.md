# Madrid Data API Client

This project samples how to implement data retrieval and formatting from a public API, by using
Retrofit for querying and heavily emphasising on a functional programming approach. Modularity is
also implemented, by using Fragments and a container on the main view.

The client can display information publicly available about institutions of Madrid, and allows the
user to choose between a list form (made with Recycler View) or a map (made with Google Maps).

Users can also apply a search filter for searching the institutions of an area with a simple 
FragmentDialog for indicating latitude and longitude, and the radius distance as well of the 
search zone.
